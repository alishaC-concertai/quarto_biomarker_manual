title: "PD-L1"

*Code updated for Q4 2022*

PD-L1 status is commonly paired with, it's receptor PD-1, so there it is possible that you may need to also peruse the PD-1 page. These are commonly investigated to check for their presence as a way to infer if there is the potential for a patient to respond to certain immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs.


**Aliases**: PD-L1, CD274


## Example Code: PT360
```{sql}
SELECT chai_patient_id,
    test_name_name,
    test_date,
    test_method_name,
    molecular_variant_name,
    genetic_test_type_name,
    test_value_name
FROM c3_pt360_202212_breast.patient_test
WHERE test_name_name SIMILAR TO 'CD274%|PD-L1%' AND 
         test_method_name not in ('Immunofluorescent Staining Method','Fluorescence in situ hybridization',
                                  'Mass Spectrometry','Not Recorded','Suppressed');
```



## Example Code: GN360
```{sql}
SELECT
    chai_patient_id,
    report_date,
    test_result,
    biomarker_test_type AS test_method_name,
    variant_grouping AS molecular_variant_name,
    biomarker_variant_type AS genetic_test_type_name
FROM c3_gn360_202212_breast.genetic_test
WHERE biomarker_name = 'CD274' AND biomarker_test_type <> 'Mass Spectrometry'

UNION

SELECT chai_patient_id,
       test_date AS report_date,
       test_value_name AS test_result,
       test_method_name,
       molecular_variant_name,
       genetic_test_type_name
FROM c3_gn360_202212_breast.patient_test
WHERE test_name_name SIMILAR TO 'CD274%|PD-L1%' AND 
         test_method_name not in ('Immunofluorescent Staining Method','Fluorescence in situ hybridization',
                                  'Mass Spectrometry','Not Recorded','Suppressed')
```


## Notes and Recommendations
- For getting positive tests, you should pull test_value_name in ('Positive','Significance undetermined') for PT360, test_value_name/test_result in ('High','Low','Intermediate','Positive')
