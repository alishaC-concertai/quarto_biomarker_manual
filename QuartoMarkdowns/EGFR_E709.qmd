title: "EGFR E709 variant"
---

This variant, located on exon 18, is a single nucleotide missense mutation changing Glutamic Acid (Glu) to another amino acid, commonly to Aspartic Acid (Asp).

This is not as common of a mutation as others like L858R and G719X, so numbers of patients with detected/positive results are going to be low.

**AA alteration**: p.E709A, p.E709K, p.E709V, p.E709Q, p.E709D, p.E709G <br>
**CDS mutation**: c.2127A>C, c.2125G>A, c.2126A>T, c.2126A>G, c.2126A>C, other others
