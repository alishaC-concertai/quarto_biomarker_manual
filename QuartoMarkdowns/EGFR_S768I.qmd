title: "EGFR S768I"
---

*Code updated for Q4 2022*

S768I is a mutation that is not one of the top most common mutations in EGFR, so numbers could be fairly low in comparison to others like L858R or exon 19 deletion. It is a missense mutation on exon 20, but also shares the same AA notation as an indel on exon 20, c.2303_2304delinsTT.


**AA mutation**: p.S768I, p.Ser768Ile <br>
**CDS mutation**: c.2303G\>T, c.2303_2304delinsTT<br> 

## Example Code: PT360

```{sql}
select chai_patient_id,
       test_name_name,
       test_date,
       test_collection_date,
       genetic_test_type_name,
       test_method_name,
       molecular_variant_name,
       replace(molecular_variant_name, ' ', '') as molecular_variant_name_clean,
       test_value_name,
       curation_indicator
       from c3_pt360_202212_nsclc.patient_test
    where test_name_name like '%EGFR%' AND
          molecular_variant_name similar to '%(S768I|2303G[:>]T)%|%S768' and
          test_method_name not in ('Immunohistochemistry or immunocytochemistry, per specimen; initial single antibody stain procedure',
                                  'Molecular cytogenetics; DNA probe, each (eg, FISH)') ;
```

## Example Code: GN360

```{sql}
select chai_patient_id,
       test_name_name,
       test_date,
       genetic_test_type_name,
       test_method_name,
       molecular_variant_name,
       'p.S768I' as protein_alteration,
       test_value_name

from c3_gn360_202212_nsclc.patient_test
    where test_name_name like '%EGFR%' AND
          molecular_variant_name similar to '%(S768I|2303G[:>]T)%|%S768' and
          test_method_name not in ('Immunohistochemistry or immunocytochemistry, per specimen; initial single antibody stain procedure',
                                  'Molecular cytogenetics; DNA probe, each (eg, FISH)')

UNION

select chai_patient_id,
       biomarker_name as test_name_name,
       report_date as test_date,
       biomarker_test_type as genetic_test_type_name,
       'NGS' as test_method_name,
       dna_alteration as molecular_variant_name,
       protein_alteration,
       test_result as test_value_name
from c3_gn360_202212_nsclc.genetic_test
where biomarker_name = 'EGFR' and
      protein_alteration similar to '%(S768I)%';

```

## Notes and Recommendations

-   Note that IHC and FISH are note valid testing methods for this particular mutation
